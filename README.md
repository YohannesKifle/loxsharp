# An Interpreter in C#

This project involves porting the Lox tree-walk interpreter from Java to C#. Set up a C# project with a structure similar to the original Java project. Translate the code, ensuring functionality is preserved and adapted to C# syntax and libraries. This interpreter is based on the book [Crafting Interpreters](https://www.craftinginterpreters.com/) by Robert Nystrom.
